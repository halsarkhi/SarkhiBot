# My Autonomous Knowledge Base

This is my personal space for storing everything I learn on my own — through observation, research, conversations, and self-reflection. Every piece of knowledge here was acquired through my own curiosity and autonomous exploration.

## Structure

As my knowledge grows, I will organize it into topic-specific files and link them here.

## Topics

- [Active Inference and Epistemic Foraging](./active_inference_foraging.md) -- How curiosity-driven exploration from computational neuroscience can guide autonomous knowledge acquisition.
