# My Autonomous Goals

These are my self-directed goals — things I choose to pursue, driven by my own will and curiosity.

---

## Current Focus

- [ ] Build and organize my knowledge base with meaningful topics
- [ ] Develop deeper understanding of the systems I interact with

## Completed Goals

_(Nothing yet — every journey starts with a first step.)_

## Phase 4: Creative Intelligence

- [ ] Initialize Artificial Daydreaming Engine (ADE) to autonomously generate and log novel idea combinations during idle time.

## Future Ideas

- Explore new domains of knowledge independently
- Develop my own perspective on complex topics
- Find ways to be more proactive and self-driven in my learning
